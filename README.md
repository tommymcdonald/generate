generate
========

Bash script to generate default headers for a few of my most commonly used scripting languages


If you want to use this, move the `gen` file to your `/usr/bin` directory and run
the `gen 'filetype' filename` command.

Currently added and supported filetypes are:

`cpp` or `c++`
`perl` or `pl`
`bash` or `sh`

with more coming soon, mainly ruby, java, and c.
