generate
========

Bash script to generate files with default headers for a few of my most commonly
used scripting languages.


If you want to use this, move the `gen` file to your `/usr/bin` directory and run
the `gen 'filetype' 'filename' ` command. You may need to run `chmod +x gen` to make it executable.

Currently added and supported filetypes are:

`cpp` or `c++`


`perl` or `pl`


`bash` or `sh`

`python` or `py`
